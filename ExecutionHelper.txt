Deep MMMF tested on MovieLens 1m and EachMovie Dataset on both strong and weak generalization.
Reported scores are average of 5 runs on different splits of train, validation and test for weak generalization. 
For strong generalization, some users have to be seperated out initially, then split both on train, validation and test. 

Code is present in the ipynb files, explained by their filenames.

Sample dataset is present in the EachMovie and ml-1m folders. 

Splits are created in the code itself.
